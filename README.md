# Contributor Summit Project Template

Contributor Summit project month is an experimental new format that builds on hack
sessions from past Contributor Summits and refocuses on long-term sustainability.
We're hoping that not only do you get a supported chance to play with some of our
new technology, but you can build it into something that contributes to the larger
DevOps community. We'll kick things off at Puppetize Live and make our first
releases at Contributor Summit Online, so this is a month-long hackathon!

Puppet will facilitate your effort during the event to help keep you from getting
blocked on some common issues and to keep your project moving along quickly. We
won't have a lot of time, so we'll all have to work effectively. See below for some
examples of resources that you will have access to.

We're glad that you're joining us on this adventure. It will be fun!

# Getting Started

It's easy to get going. We'll ask that you follow these steps and work from this
repository because it will make it much easier for us to keep track of who's working
on what projects and what your status is.

[GitHub has a useful tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) if you
need help with any of these steps.

1. Start off by creating a free GitHub account, if you don't already have one.
    * https://github.com/join
1. Fork this repository to your own namespace by clicking the *Fork* button in
   the top right of this page.
    * Remember to fork to your own namespace if you're a member of one or more organizations.
1. Now `clone` the repository to your own workstation.
    * Open your terminal window and navigate to the directory where you'd like to keep
      the local copy of your repository.
    * Run the command `git clone https://github.com/<your username>/contributor-summit-project`
1. Run the setup script to populate issues and milestones.
    * Windows
      1. Install a Ruby runtime if needed.
          * https://rubyinstaller.org
      1. Run the command `./setup.ps1`
    * Linux/Mac
      1. Install Ruby following your distribution's standards if needed.
      1. Run the command `./setup.rb`
          
## Using GitHub features
GitHub includes some optional repository features that you might be interested in.
Open the [Options](../../settings) page to check them out.

### Wikis
You might choose to keep your project documentation in a Wiki to enable low-friction
collaborative editing. If you're creating a Puppet Module, you should use the
[standard `README.md` and `REFERENCE.md` documentation pattern](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/modules_documentation.html) instead.

Reference the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis)
if you'd like more information.

### Projects
Project boards help you organize and prioritize your work. They are made up of issues,
pull requests, and notes organized as cards in columns. You can drag and drop the
cards and columns as needed. Get started by enabling the feature, then creating a new
board. Starting from a basic Kanban template will likely be the easiest way to get started.

Reference the [GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/articles/about-project-boards)
if you'd like more information.
